# Q1 — What actually happens when a program accesses memory?

I am confused about how a program gets data from memory.

Things that feel unclear:
- How does a program know where data lives?
- Who checks memory addresses?
- What does “accessing memory” actually mean?
- What happens if many programs access memory at the same time?
