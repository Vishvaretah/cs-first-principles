Rule A — No refactoring for beauty

Messy history = honest learning.

Only refactor when:

understanding changed

mental model changed

Rule B — Every folder must answer ONE question

If a folder starts answering many questions → split it.

Rule C — Notes before code (always)

For every probe:

prediction.md must exist before code is written

This single rule prevents shallow hacking.

Rule D — README is sacred

Your root README.md should explain:

why this repo exists

how you learn

what identity this serves

Not:

what technologies you use

Rule E- A question is complete when it answers its original surprise —
not when all related concepts are understood.
